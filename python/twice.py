# A function object is a value you can assign to a variable or pass as an
# argument. For example, do_twice is a function that takes a function object
# as an argument and calls it twice: def do_twice(f):f()
# f() Hereâ€™s an example that uses do_twice to call a function named print_spam
# twice.def
# print_spam():
#     print'spam'
#     do_twice(print_spam)
# 1. Type this example into a script and test it.
# 2. Modify do_twice so that it takes two arguments, a function object and a
#    value, and calls the function twice, passing the value as an argument.
# 3. Write a more general version of print_spam, called print_twice, that takes
#    a string as a parameter and prints it twice.
# 4. Use the modified version of do_twice to call print_twice twice, passing
#    'spam'as an argument.
# 5. Define a new function called do_four that takes a function object and a
#    value and calls the function four times, passing the value as a parameter.
#    There should be only two statements inthe body of this function, not four.

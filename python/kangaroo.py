# Write a definition for a class named Kangaroo with the following methods:
# 1. An init method that initializes an attribute named pouch_contents to an
# empty list.append
# 2. A method named put_in_pouch that takes an object of any
# type and adds it to pouch_contents.
# 3. A str method that returns a string representation of the Kangaroo object
# and the con-tents of the pouch.
# Test your code by creating two Kangaroo objects, assigning them to variables
# named kanga and roo, and then adding roo to the contents of kangaâ€™s pouch
